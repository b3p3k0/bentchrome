BENT CHROME – MASTER DESIGN DOCUMENT v0.3
------------------------------------------

1. OVERVIEW
------------
Title: Bent Chrome
Genre: Top-down vehicular combat
Style: 16-bit retro arcade with grimy dystopian flair
Inspirations: Twisted Metal, GTA (1997), Escape from L.A., Running Man, Cyberpunk 2020
Engine target: Godot 4 (preferred) or Unity 2D
Platforms: Linux, Windows, macOS
Input: Keyboard, Mouse, USB/BT controllers (SDL2 or native API)

Core Pillars:
- Speed and destruction
- Distinct vehicle feel
- Environmental chaos and verticality
- Tight combat flow and scavenging pressure
- Exploration rewarded through secrets and boosts


2. CORE GAMEPLAY
-----------------
Loop:
1. Enter arena → engage enemies
2. Scavenge for weapons and power-ups
3. Destroy opponents and structures for score and survival
4. Survive until victory or meet level objective

Movement:
- Strict 4-direction snap with light stat-driven polish (eight directional vectors for movement, not input model)
- Cardinal input only (WASD): no diagonals, no analog steering - preserves arcade precision
- Surface modifiers:
  * Road – standard handling
  * Dirt – reduced traction
  * Shallow water – passable, slows vehicle and affects handling
  * Deep water – impassable
- Jumps and pits for vertical variety

Combat:
- Machine Guns: standard, infinite ammo
- Primary Weapons: missiles, mines, or other collidable gimmicks. Limited ammo; replenished through pickups.
- Special Weapon: unique to each car, regenerates automatically up to a per-car maximum.
- Power-ups: temporary boosts (speed, armor, overdrive, etc.)
- Pickups: found in destructible objects or hidden locations.

Health:
- Major restore points: fully restore health; up to three total uses per level (shared cooldown).
- Minor health boosts: randomly restore 10–30% HP.
- On respawn, player begins with a limited predefined loadout.
- Inventory (primary ammo, etc.) carries forward between levels.

Opponents:
- Each level contains 1–7 enemy vehicles.
- Each car has a predefined spawn point.
- Cars are randomly assigned to spawn points at level start.


3. VEHICLE DESIGN
------------------
Philosophy: every vehicle has unique handling, weapons, and silhouette readability from top-down.

Parameters:
- Speed, armor, handling
- Machine Gun: common baseline weapon
- Primary Weapon: ammo-limited, replenished by pickups
- Special Weapon: unique per car, auto-recharges at set rate and max
- Visual and thematic consistency with driver backstory


4. ENEMY AND AI
----------------
Archetypes:
- Aggressor: relentlessly chases player
- Ambusher: uses cover and attacks opportunistically
- Defender: guards territory or objectives
- Mini-boss: unique mechanic or terrain exploit
- Boss: scripted pattern, high HP, unique weapon

AI behavior should create variety and unpredictability through movement, targeting, and aggression variance.


5. LEVELS AND PROGRESSION
--------------------------
Total: 6 levels (2 small, 3 medium, 1 large)

LEVEL ORDER:
1. **Arena (Small)**  
   - 1 enemy  
   - Compact test level and intro stage  
   - Used for player onboarding and control tutorial  

2. **Freeway (Medium)**  
   - 3 enemies  
   - Tall, vertical map design  
   - Multi-level freeway interchange with overpasses and ramps  

3. **Suburbs (Medium)**  
   - 5 enemies  
   - Flat terrain, destructible houses and fences, small trees  
   - Wide streets, minimal elevation change  

4. **Junkyard (Mini-Boss Arena, Small+)**  
   - Single mini-boss fight  
   - Destructible piles of crushed cars can be toppled for damage  
   - Limited open space and debris hazards  

5. **Downtown (Large)**  
   - 7 enemies  
   - Final main arena before boss fight  
   - Expansive city center surrounded by indestructible skyscrapers  
   - Central park and public square with a large statue or monument as landmark  
   - Some destructible mid-rise buildings, barricades, and elevated highways on edges  
   - Acts as transition to final encounter  

6. **Central Park (Medium, Boss Arena)**  
   - Boss fight stage  
   - Set within the central park section of the Downtown map  
   - Traps the player in the remaining accessible zone after Level 5  
   - Layout continuity is critical: terrain, objects, and skyline should visually match Level 5’s depiction  
   - Smaller playable area emphasizing claustrophobia and climax tension  
   - The boss leverages the environment (e.g., environmental hazards, destructible obstacles, dynamic cover)

Exploration and Secrets:
- Hidden spots grant small health boosts, power-ups, or humorous easter eggs.
- Exploration is secondary but rewarded.

Environment Features:
- Destructible props encourage active destruction.
- Verticality through ramps, overpasses, rooftops, and pits.
- Environmental hazards such as explosive barrels, electrical boxes, or crumbling debris.


6. ATMOSPHERE AND AESTHETIC
----------------------------
Tone: grimy, decaying near-future dystopia; a commercialized bloodsport world.
Visuals:
- Corroded steel, cracked asphalt, flickering neon, holo-ads
- Industrial haze and smog layers
- Signs and graffiti reflecting over-commercialized culture

Audio:
- Synth-industrial and heavy metal fusion soundtrack
- Engine growls, collisions, gunfire, ambient dystopian PA chatter


7. TECHNICAL FRAMEWORK
-----------------------
Engine: Godot 4 (GDScript + optional C# modules)
Physics: Tilemap terrain + lightweight rigid-body vehicles
Rendering: 2D sprites with pseudo-lighting overlays
Input: SDL2 or native controller API abstraction
Packaging: AppImage (Linux), with optional Flatpak later
Target Performance: 60 FPS locked on mid-range GPUs


8. FUTURE EXPANSION HOOKS
--------------------------
- Local or online multiplayer
- Vehicle customization
- Replay and photo modes
- Alternate campaign paths or endless survival mode
