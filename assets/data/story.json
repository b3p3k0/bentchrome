  "body": "The chrome doesn't bend.\nIt breaks.\n\nMarty learned that lesson the hard way when the first Corporate War turned the highways into hunting grounds. Now he runs the underground circuit where bent metal meets broken dreams, and every driver carries more scars than victories.\n\nWelcome to his world."
