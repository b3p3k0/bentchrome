  "body": "Six months ago, your inbox coughed up a message from a name no one’s seen in years—Marty Graz. The subject line just said: “Are you ready to make a deal?” You told yourself it was spam, a scam, some viral stunt. But something about it felt alive. The way the letters flickered, like they were burning. The way your reflection warped in the screen. You clicked anyway. The message was short—just a date, a set of coordinates, and one question glowing blood-red: “WILL YOU DRIVE?”\n\nNow it’s tonight. Somewhere past the edge of the city, engines snarl like chained beasts under floodlights. The sky hums with static and smoke. This is Bent Chrome—a demolition derby for the damned. Every rusted muscle car, every deathtrap on wheels, every poor soul behind the wheel is here chasing one thing: a wish. A promise from Graz himself. Win, and I’ll give you anything. Money, power, revenge, salvation—whatever burns in your gut. He always delivers. Just never the way you expect.\n\nThey say Marty Graz used to run reality shows before reality caught up. Some say he died live on air and clawed his way back through the signal. Others swear he sold his soul to the ratings gods and came out with something better: control. Now he’s the voice in the static, the smile in the smoke, the man who makes dreams explode in a shower of fire and chrome. Welcome to the show, driver. Welcome to Bent Chrome—where the prize is whatever you want, and the cost is everything else."
