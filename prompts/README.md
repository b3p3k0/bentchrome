# Prompt Log

Use this folder to capture each Claude Code interaction:

```
prompts/
  2024-09-08-init.md
  2024-09-09-combat-loop.md
```

Each entry should include:
1. **Prompt** – the exact text sent to Claude Code.
2. **Claude Plan** – the returned plan/analysis.
3. **Follow-ups** – notes or edits we apply before running the plan.

Keeping these transcripts versioned lets us compare iterations and reuse effective prompt structures.
